     <p>Hello and Welcome to our space where we will have a good time discussing and writing articles about the smartest game in the world. There are so many games in this world, there are games that require physical strength such as wrestling and other mental strength such as puzzle. There are also games that require large spaces like football and basketball and others that you can play even when you are in bed like candy crash and finally, there is the board game. This is the category with the most games on it... A game that requires mental and physical effort to beat your opponent, a game that raises the IQ level and increases the creativity and memories of person…You can call it chess... But I call it the King of Games it’s a sort of mental training, it uses the both sides brain , on the board  you need to have proper concentration power, enough creativity and have to be visionary if you want to win a chess game. Chess has no age... You can began playing chess at age 6 and become the youth champion in chess at 13. Unbelievable??! So what if I told you that you can become an international grandmaster at age of 22 .It’s not easy but also it’s not imaginary It's a true story of a child who mastered the arts of chess, it's Gary Kasparov who was the youngest world chess champion. 
As I said before Garry Born in Baku, Soviet Union (now Azerbaijan), in 1963,he began playing chess at age 6, Endowed with a strong character and an undeniable spirit of independence by age 13 was the Soviet youth champion, and won his first international tournament at age 16 in 1979. Kasparov became an international grandmaster in 1980. From 1973 to 1978 he studied under former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik.
How was this young man's journey to become a legend recognized by the chess world?
In 1978 an important event occurred and Kasparov was among the guests as he plays chess well. Where he reached the first place and became a chess master. This incident convinced the young man to become a professional chess player. More success followed, and he won the World Junior Chess Championship in Dortmund, West Germany, in 1980.By this time, he had earned the reputation of being one of the best chess players in the world and became a grandmaster at the end of the same year.
He reached new heights in his career in the 1980s. He achieved his first victory in an international superclass level tournament in Bugojno, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1982. At the beginning of 1983, he was already the world's No. 2 player, behind world chess champion Anatoly Karpov.
Before their confrontation in 1984, Kasparov and Karpov crossed swords on the chessboard only four times. The first time, Garry, only 12 years old, logically bowed, the other three duels ended in a draw. With more experience Kasparov has a catastrophic start with no less than four defeats in the first nine games, without the slightest victory to compensate, here Kasparov was the youngest world chess champion at the age of 22. What this boy has reached in this short period is enough for us to consider him a legend, but it wasn't enough for him to show his imaginative ability in the sport...
In May 1997, Garry Kasparov, the undisputed master of chess, faced an artificial intelligence program. The opponent is size: 1 meter 80 high, 1.4 tons of electronic components, and about twenty computer engineers to operate the beast. Capable of calculating more than 100 million positions per second, Deep Blue is necessarily impressive. However, Garry Kasparov has all his chances and he proves it by winning the first round. But in the second, everything changes. The machine took the lead after a 36th blow that prevented Kasparov from threatening his king. The chess champion is then put in difficulty, the machine gradually takes the lead. But suddenly, on the 44th shot, Deep Blue made a mistake. A terrible, inexplicable mistake, which could have saved Kasparov by ensuring him a draw! The machine moves its king to the wrong square and, instead of securing a victory, it offers its opponent a way out. So we can't say anything about this guy except that he's really a hero of chess 
“Chess is life in miniature. Chess is struggle, chess is battles” That's what Kasparov said when they asked him about the value of chess to him. In that way, he remained the world champion for nearly 15 years without interruption. And then in 2005 He retired from professional chess and left this sport to someone else who until that moment still has the title of world champion. Yes, this is the famous Magnus Carlson.
So be in touch with us because in our next article we will highlight the career of the hero of our present time.</p>
